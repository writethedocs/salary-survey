# Return to Office (RTO) policy

:question: In the past year, has your organization (or for contractors, any organization that you work for) implemented an RTO (return to office) policy - requesting or requiring that remote or "work from home" employees/contractors return to working on-site?

- Yes, it's required all of the time
- Yes, it's required but only part of the time (hybrid work is ok)
- Yes, it's encouraged but not mandatory
- Yes, but only for some roles
- No, remote work is still allowed/encouraged/required
- No, my position has always been on-site only
- I don't know, or it doesn't apply to the kind of work I do
