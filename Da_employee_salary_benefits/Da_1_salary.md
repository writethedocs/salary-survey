# Your salary

Please enter your salary before taxes are taken out, and indicate whether this is a monthly or yearly amount (in some countries it is customary to talk about monthly salary, while in others yearly figures are more common). Monthly figures will be multiplied by 12 for comparison with yearly figures.

If your total compensation is made up of a base salary and significant bonus, equity or commission payments, please enter your total compensation (or an average, if it fluctuates).

For privacy, the salary figure you enter will be masked until you check the "Show my salary" box below.
