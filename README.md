# Write the Docs Annual Documentation Salary Survey 

Write the Docs runs an annual salary survey for people working in documentation and related fields. The survey results are made available each year here: [https://writethedocs.org/surveys/](https://www.writethedocs.org/surveys/)

The core set of questions undergoes revision each year, to accommodate changing conditions in the industry, feedback from the community, and to resolve issues that come up during data processing. 

This project allows community members to propose and discuss improvements to the survey questions and instructions directly.

## Timeline

The survey for the current year is opened for submissions in early September and closed at the end of December. The results are released at the beginning of April of the following year. 

To allow time to build and test the survey form, **the deadline for finalizing the questions for the 2025 survey is July 01, 2025.**

## Organization

The questions are divided into eight sections:

<ol type="A">
  <li>Employment parameters</li>
  <li>Job changes</li>
  <li>Workplace</li>
  <li>Salary and benefits/Rates</li>
  <li>Satisfaction</li>
  <li>Organization demographics</li>
  <li>Respondent demographics</li>
  <li>Survey feedback</li>
</ol>

This repository is a clickable, barebones wireframe version of the survey site. Each question is in an individual markdown file.

## Considerations

When proposing changes, keep the following in mind:

- questions should relate to the core objective of the survey: to help community members determine what an appropriate salary range looks like 
- continuity from one year to the next is important, to allow changes over time to be observed - changes to existing questions should not change the context in which the question was previously asked
- the length of the survey is already pushing the limits of good taste, so any significant additions need to be evaluated carefully to make sure they don't negatively impact the survey's completion rate
- use inclusive, gender-neutral, non-biased, unambiguous language - and remember that respondents may be employed, unemployed, contractors or freelancers, in any country or region, and that while "technical writer" is historically the most common role amongst the Write the Docs community, many people working in documentation are not technical writers 
- multiple choice (either single answer, or multple answer) questions are favoured over open-ended or text-entry questions, for ease of data processing
