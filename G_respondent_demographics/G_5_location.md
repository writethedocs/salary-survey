# Your location

While most questions in this section are optional, general geographical location is not - this is because without it, we cannot calculate median salaries, which is one of the main objectives of the survey. For privacy reasons, finer-grained geographical location is optional.

:question: Please enter your town or city, or the nearest large city that you feel comfortable specifying.

If the autofill does not include a state or province for your location, please enter N/A.

[city] [state / province / region] [country]
