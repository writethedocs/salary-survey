# Extra statutory benefits

:question: Does your salary package include any of the following statutory benefits, in excess of the required minimums?

Please indicate if you receive any of the following benefits, in excess of any government-mandated minimums that may apply, as part of your salary package.

Check all that apply, or select "none of the above".

For example, in Germany, employees are legally entitled to 20 days of paid vacation per year. An employee living in Germany who has a paid vacation allowance of 30 days would therefore select "paid vacation" for this question, as they receive more than the government mandated minimum.

- Paid vacation
- Paid parental leave
- Paid sick leave
- Healthcare benefits
- Pension / superannuation / retirement
- I'm not sure
- None of the above
