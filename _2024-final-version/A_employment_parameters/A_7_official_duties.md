Contractors: substitute "area of expertise" or "professional offering" for "official job description", as appropriate to your situation.

- not officially part of my job description, but I am expected to perform documentation-related tasks
- not officially part of my job description, and I am not expected to perform documentation-related tasks, but I do anyway
