# Current employment status

## Additional instructions

:bulb: For those who have worked as both an employee and as a contractor in the past year.

This is a new option we’re trying this year. We’re going to show you questions for both employees and contractors.

Some of the questions may have different answers depending on whether you’re considering them as an employee or as a contractor. In these cases, you can:

- answer as whichever you spent the most time working as (in the past year); or
- answer as whichever you earned the most income from; or
- answer as whichever is the most regular mode of working for you.
