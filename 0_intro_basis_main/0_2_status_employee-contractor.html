<p>This is a new option we’re trying this year. We’re going to show you questions for both employees and contractors.</p>

<p>Some of the questions may have different answers depending on whether you’re considering them as an employee or as a contractor. In these cases, you can:</p>

<ul>
  <li>answer as whichever you spent the most time working as (in the past year); or</li>
  <li>answer as whichever you earned the most income from; or</li>
  <li>answer as whichever is the most regular mode of working for you.</li>
</ul>
