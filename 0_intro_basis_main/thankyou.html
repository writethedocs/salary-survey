<h2 id="you-rock">You rock!</h2>

<p>Thank you very, very much for completing the 2024 Write the Docs Salary Survey. With every submission, we gain a clearer picture of the state of documentation around the world.</p>

<h2 id="spread-the-word">Spread the word</h2>

<p>The relevance and value of survey data increases with the number of respondents, and our aim is always to reach a wider audience of documentarians. You can help us to spread the word by passing the link to this survey along to anyone you know who cares about documentation.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Share on Twitter</li>
  <li>Share on LinkedIn</li>
  <li>Share on Facebook</li>
  <li>Share via email</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="got-feedback">Got feedback?</h2>

<p>If you didn’t take the opportunity to leave feedback at the end of the survey (or even if you did), you can always use our feedback form to tell us privately what you did and didn’t like. We’re always looking for ways we can improve.</p>

<p>And if you’d like to share a comment or testimonial for publication on the WTD web site or in our newsletter or social media, we’ve got a place for you to do that too.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Tell us what you think</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="whats-next">What’s next?</h2>

<p>The results of this survey will be made available to everyone, for free, in the Write the Docs surveys section, in the first quarter of 2025. The best way to make sure that you hear about it is to sign up to the Write the Docs email newsletter.</p>

<p>If you’re new to Write the Docs, here are some places where you can find out more about our amazing community and the things that we do:</p>
