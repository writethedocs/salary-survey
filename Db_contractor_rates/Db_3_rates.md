# Your rates

## Rates Comparison

Comparing payment rates for contractors, freelancers and self-employed people is difficult due to the number of different ways that individuals in this group operate.

To simplify this as much as possible while still allowing comparisons, please estimate one or more of the following rate types, even if you normally use a different fee structure.

Don't include any VAT, GST or sales tax. If you normally charge different rates, enter your most common rate, or an average if you feel that is more representative.

For privacy, the rate figures you enter will be masked until you check the "Show my rates" box below.
